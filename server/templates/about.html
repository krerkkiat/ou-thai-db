      <p>This is the sample web application that allows the Thai script to be used in the search term. It also configured with a proper analyzer for the field that contains Thai words in Thai script.</p>
      <p>The original website seems to lack this functionality thus it leaves user with only the romanized script as a search term which can be hard use. To illustrate the lack of support for Thai script as a search term, you can fill in the following pharse into the title box at the original site then hit search button <code>นิธิ</code>. While the original site returns the no result found page. This web application returns resonable results for <code>นิธิ</code>. In fact any another search term that is in Thai script can be used on the original site, but the web site always returns the no result page.</p>
      <p>This current version of the application is just a prototype. Its database contains non of the data from the original website. However, the full database of the original website can be re-indexed. This  will then enable user to search the database using the Thai script.</p>
      <p>The data is index to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> backend with a proper analyzer for Thai language. This Elasticsearch backend then provides the search functionaly for this web application.</p>
